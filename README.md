            The <span class="highlight">Medicine-Details-System</span> is a practical application designed to manage and display drug information. This system has been developed using the Python programming language and two powerful libraries: <span class="highlight">tkinter</span> and <span class="highlight">kiwi</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">tkinter</span> is a standard library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python, allowing developers to create windows, buttons, input fields, and other user interface elements. On the other hand, <span class="highlight">kiwi</span> is a utility library for performing various operations in Python, which can be used in this system for data processing and calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            This system enables users to enter, search, edit, and delete drug information. It also provides the ability to display complete details of each drug, including name, dosage, side effects, drug interactions, and other related information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="highlight">Medicine-Details-System</span> can be used in various environments such as pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics to simplify and streamline the management of drug information.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use this system, users can take advantage of its simple and user-friendly graphical interface, allowing them to manage drug information without requiring advanced technical knowledge.
